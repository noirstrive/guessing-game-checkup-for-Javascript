created a small guessing game where it displays a number onto a <p> element 
created 2 variables which are number and guess. 
used the Math.rndm function and then with an simple if statement, 
i tried to compare if the number which is inputet into the prompt window is actually a number. 
if you leave it empty it will display something like this : “Please enter a valid number.”
if you enter a number and the number is too high or to low it will also display that onto the screen. 

i created a reset button so that if you dont want to guess on your current guessing number, 
than you can get a new nubmber or when you are done and you are correct with your guess, 
after that you can play anohter round so you wont have to update the whole page.
